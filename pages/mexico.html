        <div class="card">
            <h2>Mexico Overview</h2>
            <p>Mexico City is one of the largest and most populated cities in the whole world. It experiences environmental problems that pose danger to the residents such as pollution, garbage, and urbanization.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Environmental Challenges</h2>
            <p>Vehicular emissions, along with industrial activities and construction dust are responsible for instance in particular air pollution, whereas excessive levels of PM10 and PM2.5, ozone together with other pollutants lead to illnesses such as respiratory and cardiovascular diseases that are not easy to treat but have limited level of exposure short. Just to give one example, the city of Mexico has experienced more than ten thousand deaths yearly resulting from this issue alone while the latest data concerning PM2.5 shows that it has gone past the levels set by WHO thus making it very risky.</p>
            <p>The underground, 50 million-year-old Rio Tinto River has acidic mine runoff leading to animal deaths and aquatic life loss, which then mixes with alkaline waters. Around 13,000 tons of solid waste are produced daily in Mexico City, however, only about 12% can be considered recycled materials compared to hazardous or electronic waste; most of them end up in near brim landfills. Consequently contaminating soil, nearly half of all electronic wastes are left unrecycled leading to water contamination from hazardous materials.</p>
            <p>Increasingly cities have reduced green spaces by 25% over the last ten years and also infringed on agricultural land increasing number people using automobiles resulting to more carbon emissions. Housing: About 40% of the population stays in slums without basic goods such as clean water, proper sanitation facilities or garbage collection systems.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Actions Taken</h2>
            <h3>Air Quality Improving Initiatives</h3>
            <p>One day a week, cars are banned from circulating based on their vehicle plate numbers. The program's effectiveness has been questioned. This involves promoting electric and hybrid vehicles alongside enhancing public transport which includes over 200 new electric buses.</p>
            
            <h3>Water Management Initiatives</h3>
            <p>Programs for water conservation reduce errors as well as promote rainwater collection with repairs done for leaking pipes which have all contributed to reducing water losses by 10%. Investments like the Atotonilco wastewater treatment plant have seen more than 60% of Mexico City’s sewage treated.</p>
            
            <h3>Waste Management Improvements</h3>
            <p>Programs specifically devoted to recycling have been initiated to raise recycling levels while at the same time laying down plans that will see waste disposal get formal within five years. Regarding landfill control, activities are under way aimed at closing old and developing new ones which have a high environmental concern ratio.</p>
            
            <h3>Urban Planning and Green Spaces</h3>
            <p>Planting trees and creating green belts to improve air quality and fight heat islands, reforestation, and green belts with over 5 million trees planted recently. Developing environmentally friendly housing to substitute informal settlements with solar panels and rainwater collection is called for in sustainable housing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Outcomes and Challenges</h2>
            <p>Improvements like reduced vehicle emissions are noted but air quality remains a major issue which shows that there are mixed results. Water shortages and pollution persist and this calls for an increased investment and regional cooperation amid a water crisis. Challenges of the informal sector and public cooperation are still there despite the progress in waste management. For instance, the management of sprawl as well as the promotion of sustainable development in urban settings require more strict regulatory frameworks and stronger enforcement.</p>
